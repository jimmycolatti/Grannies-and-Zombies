          <h1>Instructions</h1>
          <p>
            Zombies have taken over our town and they're heading towards our
            small 55+ community! You need to protect our neighborhood from being
            overtaken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't let the zombies hit you, they hurt! Shoot them down before
            they get past you and into your neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use your mouse to choose your Granny up at the top then plant that
            Granny down in a cell to defend her ground. When she sees a zombie
            in front of her, she'll shoot!
          </p>
          <p>
            Use your mouse to hover over the purses that will appear on the map
            to collect more resources and purchase more Granny defenders.
